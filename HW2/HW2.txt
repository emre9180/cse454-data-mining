a) Explain chamelon clustering algorithm. Use figures and formulas. Give the pseudo code. Explain each part in the pseudo code. (25 pts)

b) Give advantages and disadvantages of the model. Compare the algorithm with the other clustering algorithms in terms of time, perfomance and memory consumption. (10 pts)

c) What is the time complexity of it? Explain your reasons (for each step of the algorithm, I expect you to show the time complexity of that step. Just writing the final time complexity is not enough as an answer. (5pts)

d) Implement the algorithm using any programming language. Copy paste the code addition to uploading Teams. (30 pts)

e) Show clustering results for 4 randomly chosen parameter values, for each parameter. (15 pts) You must use worms dataset mentioned on the web site https://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/ 

f) Show the results using another distance other than euclidean distance. (15 pts)

 

Notes:


	
 The answers must be hand written.
	
 You have to solve the questions and implement the codes by yourself. You can not use codes from internet.
	
 You shouldnâ€™t use data mining tools. If you feel like there is a need for that send a message to me. I will inform you immediately.
	
 Upload your code that includes enough comments making your code understandable. I will add an additional assignment link.
	
 Take a video where you explain the code in details. And add the link to your assignment. I may ask an additional demo section, if I feel like there is a need for it.
	
 Results extracted from any other dataset will not be accepted. 
	
 If you can not answer the question d, your answers in question e and and f will not be accepted.
